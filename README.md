<h2>Task 1 Caterpillar Game</h2>
Letâ€™s have a look at the process of creating the caterpillar game with Python you can say algorithm for this game 


<h3>Algorithm:</h3>

Step 1. first start with  setting the properties of leaf and the caterpillar.

Step 2. Then set the starting values like the speed and size of the caterpillar at the start of the game and the score of the game.

Step 3. Then  program the caterpillar to move forward, here I will be using the if and else statements; to check if the caterpillar has made contact with the leaf or not.

Step 4. If the caterpillar has not made contact with the leaf we will check that whether it has left the screen or not, if it has left the screen  stop the game and show the game over.

Step 5. If the caterpillar has not made contact with leaf. move the leaf in a now random position and increase the size of the caterpillar and increase the score. 

Step 6. And keep repeating this process.
